# Modelling for Time Series Data using PyCaret


## <a id="overview"></a>Overview
This article is the second article in series of the previous one. In previous article, we performed EDA on the time series data loaded using Refinitiv Data library and PyCaret. In this article, we will make use of AutoML functionalities available in PyCaret, select best model, fine tune the selected model, make use of blended models and evaluate them.

Details and concepts are further explained in the [Modelling and Evaluation - Time Series Forecasting using PyCaret](https://developers.refinitiv.com/en/article-catalog/article/modelling-and-evaluation-using-pycaret-on-time-series-data) article published on the [Refinitiv Developer Community portal](https://developers.refinitiv.com).
